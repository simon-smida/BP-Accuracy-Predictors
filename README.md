# Design of accuracy predictors for CNNs in NAS
This project focuses on designing, implementing and comparing accuracy predictors (ML models) for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the context of Neural Architecture Search (NAS).

## Overview
This repository hosts the essential source code, datasets, and utility tools needed for constructing and evaluating accuracy predictors for CNNs using a range of machine learning models. The primary objectives include examining diverse input features, comparing distinct methodologies for developing model-based predictors, and enhancing the efficiency of NAS by delivering precise and computationally effective performance estimates for a variety of CNN architectures.
